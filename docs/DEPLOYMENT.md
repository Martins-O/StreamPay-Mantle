# Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

Before deploying StreamPay Mantle, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed
- **Foundry** toolkit installed
- **Git** for version control
- **Mantle testnet MNT** for gas fees
- **Private key** for deployment account
- **Mantlescan API key** for contract verification

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install Foundry

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 2. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/streampay-mantle.git
cd streampay-mantle
```

### 3. Configure Environment

#### Contracts Environment

```bash
cd contracts
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

```bash
# Deployment
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x_prefix
MANTLESCAN_API_KEY=your_mantlescan_api_key

# RPC URLs
MANTLE_TESTNET_RPC=https://rpc.testnet.mantle.xyz
MANTLE_MAINNET_RPC=https://rpc.mantle.xyz
```

#### Frontend Environment

```bash
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```bash
# WalletConnect Project ID (get from cloud.walletconnect.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

# Contract addresses (will be filled after deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_MANAGER_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_USDT_ADDRESS=

# RPC URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_MANTLE_TESTNET_RPC=https://rpc.testnet.mantle.xyz
```

## Smart Contract Deployment

### 1. Prepare for Deployment

```bash
cd contracts

# Install dependencies
forge install

# Run tests to ensure everything works
forge test

# Check compilation
forge build
```

### 2. Deploy Contracts

#### Option A: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x deploy.sh
chmod +x verify.sh

# Deploy all contracts
./deploy.sh
```

The script will:
- Run tests before deployment
- Deploy StreamManager (which creates StreamVault)
- Deploy Mock USDT token
- Save addresses to `deployment.env`
- Attempt contract verification

#### Option B: Manual Deployment

```bash
# Deploy contracts
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:DeployScript \
  --rpc-url $MANTLE_TESTNET_RPC \
  --broadcast \
  --verify

# Manual verification if needed
./verify.sh
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

After successful deployment, you should see:

```bash
âœ… Deployment successful!
StreamManager deployed to: 0x...
StreamVault deployed to: 0x...
Mock USDT deployed to: 0x...
```

### 4. Update Frontend Configuration

Copy the deployed addresses to your frontend environment:

```bash
# Copy addresses from deployment.env to frontend/.env.local
cat contracts/deployment.env >> frontend/.env.local
```

## Frontend Deployment

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Build and Test Locally

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start
```

### 3. Deploy to Hosting Platform

#### Vercel Deployment

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

#### Netlify Deployment

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify (drag & drop .next folder)
# Or use Netlify CLI
```

#### IPFS Deployment (Decentralized)

```bash
# Build for static export
npm run build

# Upload to IPFS using your preferred method
# (Pinata, Fleek, or local IPFS node)
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Contract Verification Checklist

- [ ] StreamManager verified on Mantlescan
- [ ] StreamVault verified on Mantlescan
- [ ] Mock USDT verified on Mantlescan
- [ ] All contracts have correct source code
- [ ] ABI matches deployed bytecode

### 2. Frontend Verification Checklist

- [ ] Wallet connection works
- [ ] Network switching to Mantle testnet
- [ ] Contract interactions successful
- [ ] Real-time updates functioning
- [ ] Error handling works properly

### 3. End-to-End Testing

Test the complete flow:

1. **Connect Wallet**
   ```
   - MetaMask connection
   - Network switching
   - Balance display
   ```

2. **Get Test Tokens**
   ```
   - Mint mock USDT tokens
   - Check balance updates
   - Approve StreamManager spending
   ```

3. **Create Stream**
   ```
   - Fill out form
   - Submit transaction
   - Verify stream creation
   - Check dashboard updates
   ```

4. **Monitor Stream**
   ```
   - Real-time counter updates
   - Progress bar animation
   - Streamable amount calculation
   ```

5. **Claim/Cancel Operations**
   ```
   - Claim functionality
   - Cancel functionality
   - Balance updates
   - Event emission
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

#### "Insufficient Gas" Error
```bash
# Increase gas limit in foundry.toml
[profile.default]
gas_limit = 10000000
```

#### "Nonce Too Low" Error
```bash
# Reset account nonce or wait for previous transactions
cast nonce $YOUR_ADDRESS --rpc-url $MANTLE_TESTNET_RPC
```

#### Contract Verification Failed
```bash
# Manually verify using the verify.sh script
./verify.sh

# Or verify individual contracts
forge verify-contract \
  --chain-id 5003 \
  --num-of-optimizations 200 \
  --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor()") \
  --etherscan-api-key $MANTLESCAN_API_KEY \
  $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  src/StreamManager.sol:StreamManager
```

### Frontend Issues

#### "Module Not Found" Error
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

#### Wallet Connection Issues
```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID

# Verify contract addresses
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_MANAGER_ADDRESS
```

#### Contract Interaction Failures
```bash
# Check network configuration
# Verify contract addresses
# Check wallet has sufficient gas
```

## Network Configuration

### Mantle Testnet Details

```json
{
  "chainId": 5003,
  "chainName": "Mantle Sepolia Testnet",
  "rpcUrls": ["https://rpc.testnet.mantle.xyz"],
  "nativeCurrency": {
    "name": "Mantle",
    "symbol": "MNT",
    "decimals": 18
  },
  "blockExplorerUrls": ["https://explorer.testnet.mantle.xyz"]
}
```

### Adding to MetaMask

Users need to add Mantle testnet to their wallet:

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click "Add Network"
3. Enter the network details above
4. Save and switch to network

## Production Considerations

### Security Checklist

- [ ] Private keys stored securely
- [ ] Environment variables not committed
- [ ] Contract ownership transferred appropriately
- [ ] Multi-sig setup for production
- [ ] Emergency pause mechanisms tested
- [ ] Audit completed for mainnet deployment

### Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Transaction monitoring
- [ ] Gas usage tracking
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] User activity analytics
- [ ] Contract state monitoring

### Backup Procedures

- [ ] Contract source code backed up
- [ ] Deployment scripts versioned
- [ ] Environment configurations documented
- [ ] Recovery procedures tested

This deployment guide ensures a smooth and secure deployment of StreamPay Mantle on the Mantle L2 testnet.
